# Mean-Eccentricity-of-Graph-in-C
Calculation of the mean eccentricity in a graph

## How to setup
First, you need to open "Adjacency Matrix" and define the number of the nodes in the graph. Then you need to create the connections in the graph
by making the nodes equal to 1 if the nodes are connected. If you followed the steps in the righ order, the code should run just fine. Make sure you 
have the files in the same folder and that the name of the files is the same as the one you define in the beginning. Feel free to contact me for any information.
